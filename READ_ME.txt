Connecting the display enviorment on a personal device:

1. Install VSCode (DON'T USE ARDUINO IDE!)
2. Install PlatformIO exteniton in the extensions tab
3. Clone the project repository using the terminal command -> "git clone (insert link to this repository)"
-> This will give you access to the LVGL graphics library the display uses + the code for the display components
4. Open the project folder in VSCode 
5. Connect display using Type-C cable from USB port on the display to personal device
6. Navigate to PlatformIO extension and notice three options: "Default", "Native", and "esp32-s3-devkitc-1"

-> esp32-s3-devkitc-1 and Native (when expanded) gives options to build, upload, and monitor code
  -> esp32-s3-devkitc-1 launches the code onto the display directly
  -> Native launches an enviorment onto personal device
     -> *Optional* for testing on personal device:
        (install SDL2 drivers online to allow for native to work)
